Leap Frog method applied to the Logistic Diffeq

In the course the point is made that the leap frog method for solving Diffeqs
looks like a good alternative for Euler's method, but that it isn't.

This assignment illustrates the point by comparing Euler and Leap Frog approximations to the solution of a very simple diffeq, namely the logistic equation.
The conclusion is that while the leap frog method is not reliable, it does
produce surprising pictures.
